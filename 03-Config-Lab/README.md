As we can see there is an alarm raised. This alarm states that we are not
streaming the CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch. Let’s proceed and remediate this
alarm.

9)  Go to CloudTrail console – to do so search CloudTrail in the AWS Search
    Service bar. Once on the console click on *View Trails* and click on the
    trail created previously.

10)  In the configuration page, under the CloudWatch Logs section press the
    *Configure*.
